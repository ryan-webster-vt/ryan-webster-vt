# Greetings 👋

🎓 Recent graduate from **Virginia Tech** (Go Hokies! 🦃) with dual B.S. degrees in **Statistics** and **Computational Modeling & Data Analytics**, plus minors in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**.

🔍 I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights, solve real-world problems, and drive better decision-making. Whether it's building predictive models, cleaning and analyzing messy datasets, or creating interactive dashboards, I'm all in.

## 🧪 Projects

### March Madness At-Large Predictor  
Built a predictive model to identify at-large bids for the 2025 NCAA March Madness Tournament by web-scraping team metrics using `rvest` from sites like College Basketball Reference and Barttorvik. After engineering features related to team efficiency, strength of schedule, and win metrics, I tested multiple machine learning approaches and selected Ridge Regression for its strong performance and ability to handle multicollinearity. The final model achieved 96% accuracy, correctly predicting 36 of the 37 at-large teams selected.

### Hospital Database  
Developed a full-stack, fictional hospital management system emphasizing SQL-based relational database design, implementation, and management. The backend is powered by Python’s Flask framework, with a dynamic front-end built using HTML/CSS. The system supports secure user authentication (sign-up, login, password change) and displays personalized content based on user roles (Admin, Doctor/Nurse, Patient), enabling customized access to features and data.
