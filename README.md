# Greetings 👋

My name is Ryan Webster and I am a recent graduate from **Virginia Tech** (Go Hokies! 🦃) with dual B.S. degrees in **Statistics** and **Computational Modeling & Data Analytics**, plus minors in **Computer Science** and **Mathematics**.

I'm actively seeking opportunities in data analytics, data science, or related roles where I can apply my skills to solve meaningful problems.

## Projects

### Non-Contact Injury Risk Analysis
Led a team of 4 to develop a Cox Proportional Hazards Model analyzing telemetry and health data for 100+ collegiate football athletes across 300+ variables. The model identified seven key predictors of non-contact injury risk, leveraging survival analysis techniques to handle time-to-event data with censoring. Designed an interactive R script with version control via Git to generate individualized injury probability forecasts over customizable timeframes, empowering coaching staff to make data-driven decisions for player health management. Delivered actionable recommendations to stakeholders, demonstrating how predictive modeling can reduce injury risk in high-performance athletics.

### March Madness At-Large Predictor  
Built a predictive model to identify at-large bids for the 2025 NCAA March Madness Tournament by web-scraping team metrics using `rvest` from sites like College Basketball Reference and Barttorvik. After engineering features related to team efficiency, strength of schedule, and win metrics, I tested multiple machine learning approaches and selected Ridge Regression for its strong performance and ability to handle multicollinearity. The final model achieved 96% accuracy, correctly predicting 36 of the 37 at-large teams selected.

### Hospital Database  
Developed a full-stack, fictional hospital management system emphasizing SQL-based relational database design, implementation, and management. The backend is powered by Python’s Flask framework, with a dynamic front-end built using HTML/CSS. The system supports secure user authentication (sign-up, login, password change) and displays personalized content based on user roles (Admin, Doctor/Nurse, Patient), enabling customized access to features and data.
